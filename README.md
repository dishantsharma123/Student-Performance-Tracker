Perfect 👍 You’ve got **two README drafts** – one very detailed and one more simplified. I’ll merge them into a **final polished `README.md`** that includes all useful points (features, setup, project structure, deployment, future enhancements, etc.) without repeating unnecessarily.

Here’s the final version:
